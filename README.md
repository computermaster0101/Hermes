Inspired by Push2Run.

See https://www.push2run.com/help/setup_dropbox.html for backend file integration 

use a number and a text ingreadiant where the number is attached to a keyword such as system or jarvis. This will be used to identify which system should pickup the file. (ie javis7 or system23)

I've added some images of my ifttt.com setup to aid in configuration. This readme really sucks

model rules and actions off exsiting exampes.

more to come for this readme. This readme still sucks.
